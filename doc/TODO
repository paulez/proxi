- write REST api to get messages, should require location in WGS84 format
* url api/messages/latitude/longitude
- think about authentication
* temporary auth token only valid for a given location ?
* posting would require a auth token
* if client has moved, reauthentication is required
- fix search logic
- needs to run full https (geolocation not allowed in http)
- weird behaviour when user is using same pseudo (login allowed, cannot post)
